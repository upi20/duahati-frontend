    <p class="fz-14">One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found himself transformed in his
      bed into a horrible vermin.</p>
    <p class="fz-14">He lay on his armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he could see his brown
      belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff sections.</p>
    <p class="fz-14">The bedding was hardly able to cover it and seemed ready to slide off any moment.</p>
    <p class="fz-14">His many legs, pitifully thin compared with the size of the rest of him, waved about helplessly
      as he looked. "What's happened to me? " he thought.</p>
    <p class="fz-14">It wasn't a dream. His room, a proper human room although a little too small, lay peacefully
      between its four familiar walls.</p>
    <p class="fz-14">A collection of textile samples lay spread out on the table - Samsa was a travelling salesman -
      and above it there hung a picture that he had recently cut out of an illustrated magazine and housed in a
      nice, gilded frame.</p>
    <p class="fz-14">It showed a lady fitted out with a fur hat and fur boa who sat upright, raising a heavy fur
      muff that covered the whole of her lower arm towards the viewer. Gregor then turned to look out the window at
      the dull weather.</p>
